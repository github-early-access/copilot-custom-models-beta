# Copilot Custom Models - Limited Public Beta

We’re thrilled to announce that starting today, GitHub Copilot Custom Models is now in Limited Public Beta. With Custom Models, you can fine-tune GitHub Copilot to better align with your organization’s unique coding environment. This means that your developers will receive code suggestions that are more contextually relevant, leveraging your proprietary libraries, frameworks, and even specialized languages. Imagine Copilot understanding the intricacies of your internal tools, adhering to your specific coding standards, and helping your team code faster and with greater accuracy—all while staying within your established workflows.

To get started, we’re launching this beta with selected enterprise customers who have substantial proprietary codebases, unique programming languages, or extensive internal libraries. This is your chance to shape the future of AI-enhanced development, contributing directly to how Copilot can best serve complex and specialized environments. Whether you're looking to improve the consistency of code completions or to reduce time spent on repetitive coding tasks, GitHub Copilot Custom Models offers a powerful new level of customization and productivity.

Join the beta today and experience how much more Copilot can do when it’s tailored specifically to your code. We're excited for you to test out and provide feedback as we iterate on the feature.
